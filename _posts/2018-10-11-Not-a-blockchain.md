If 25 years ago somebody would have claimed to deliver pizza as e-mail
attachment, the implausibility would have probably been lost for most
people, as almost nobody was familiar with e-mail at the time. Similarly,
today [Carrefour Italia](blockchain.carrefour.it/?lot=315123&skunr=PRD100023&shelflifedate=17.10.2018) and others claim to track food using blockchain.

Whoever promotes QR encoded URLs as blockchain must be ridiculed.
A legitimate QR code can be simply copied on illegitimate products:
as such the landing web page is not reliable at all.

Moreover, it is true and far-reaching that the (bitcoin) blockchain can
guarantee [time-stamping](opentimestamps.org/), but it cannot
guarantee validity, correctness, or accuracy of the content being
time-stamped. So, despite landing on a legitimate web page, whatever has
been time-stamped on the blockchain and is displayed on that web page
can be simply false.
You can order pizza via e-mail, but it cannot be delivered by e-mail.

Finally, if https is not used, if the time-stamping is not digitally signed,
if a non-bitcoin blockchain is used,
all these details do compromise the reliability further.

[IBM Food Trust](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust),
[EY Wine Blockchain](https://www.ey.com/it/it/services/advisory/ey-blockchain),
this Carrefour attempt, and similar campaigns are just
dishonest marketing gimmick, i.e. misleading advertising.

What is infuriating about these initiatives is the attempt to promote trust
in non-sound technological choices;
according to the noted security expert Bruce Schneier
"supply-chain security is an incredibly complex problem‚Äù
(see [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/05/08/banning-chinese-phones-wont-fix-security-problems-with-our-electronic-supply-chain)):
what is an "insurmountable problem right now" for electronics,
it is a daunting task for chickens too.
