title: Not a blockchain!

If 25 years ago somebody would have claimed to deliver pizza as email
attachment, the implausibility would have probably been lost for most
people, as almost nobody was familiar with email at the time. Similarly,
today Carrefour Italia claims to track food using blockchain.

Whoever promotes QR encoded URLs as blockchain must be ridiculed.
A legitimate QR code can be simply copied on illegitimate products:
as such the landing web page is not reliable.

Moreover, it is true and far-reaching that the (bitcoin) blockchain can
guarantee [time-stamping](https://opentimestamps.org/), but it cannot
guarantee validity, correctness, or accuracy of the content being
time-stamped. So, despite landing on a legitimate web page, whatever has
been notarized on the blockchain and is displayed on the web page 
can be false.
You can order pizza via email, but it cannot be delivered by email.

Finally, if https is not used, if the notarizations are not signed, if a
non-bitcoin blockchain is used, all these details do compromise the
reliability further.

The [IBM Food Trust](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust), 
the
[EY Wine Blockchain](https://www.ey.com/it/it/services/advisory/ey-blockchain),
this Carrefour attempt, and similar campaigns are just
dishonest marketing gimmick, i.e. misleading advertising.

What is infuriating about these initiatives is the attempt to promote trust
in non-sound technological choices: noted security expert Bruce Schneier
called supply-chain security “an insurmountably hard problem.”, it is
a daunting task for electronics
(see Bruce Schneier on [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/05/08/banning-chinese-phones-wont-fix-security-problems-with-our-electronic-supply-chain)), and chickens too.
