anyone else, please consider <https://dgi.io/workshop>.

## Learning objectives

The course is an introduction to bitcoin
crypto- assets,
and the associated blockchain technology.

Game theory, computer science (distributed systems, distributed
consensus), and monetary theory elements are examined
in the attempt to properly convey the interdisciplinarity of the topics
and appreciate their relevance.

## Prerequisites

There are no strict prerequisites,
even if a computer science mindset
and some familiarity with algebra and finance
might help to appreciate the course.
While a rigorous formal approach is almost impossible
in a course touching on so many and so different knowledge areas,
intellectual curiosity is stimulated about the interplay between
maths, cryptography, economic incentives, technology,
monetary theory, regulatory issues, and politics.

## Teaching method

Slide based lessons with associated bibliography.

## Teaching language

English.

## Assessment

Multi-choice questions test.
