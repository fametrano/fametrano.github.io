This book is about the American pilgrimage of four American Catholics: F. O'Connor, W. Percy, T. Merton, and D. Day. I could not help but think about your music, and how I feel your work belongs to this great American tradition.

"A pilgrimage is a journey undertaken in the light of a story," i.e. because something has happened somewhere and even if it is not clear to us we know it is for us.

You said: "once a Catholic, always a Catholic", but it is not the Catholic tag: it is something related to the recognition that while we "search through the dust, looking for a sign" our hearts are sure there is a place for us across the border and we will meet there.

"Certain books, certain writers, reach us at the center of ourselves, and we come to them in fear and trembling, in hope and expectation - reading so as to change, and perhaps to save, our lives."

Bruce, thank you for helping me pray Him to rise up, here and now, in my life, in this city of ruins. We don't know each other, yet we are together and we will meet further on up the road.

PS I wrote you in '99, about the Kosovo refugees. Thank you very much for joining that cause, and especially for being so kind to remember me three months later in Genova, when you dedicated "The Ghost Of Tom Joad" to the Banco Alimentare (Food Bank)
