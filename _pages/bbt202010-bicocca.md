## Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology, Fall 2020

Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods, University of Milano-Bicocca

__Because of COVID-19 the course will be streaming only.__

e-learning: <https://elearning.unimib.it/course/view.php?id=31548>

If you have an e-mail _@campus.unimib.it_
please join the 202010-bicocca channel in the Slack
[BBT workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/bbt-training/signup)
using your first and last name (no nicknames)
and a profile picture.
Updates and conversations about the course will be posted in the Slack channel.

The course is for the students of University of Milano-Bicocca only;
anyone else, please consider <https://dgi.io/workshop>.

## Learning objectives

The course is an introduction to bitcoin and the associated blockchain
technology.

Starting from a computationally focused approach to
elliptic curves over finite fields and
presenting the discrete logarithm problem as cornerstone of public-key
cryptography, bitcoin is introduced as ingenious breakthrough innovation.

Its game theory, computer science (distributed systems, distributed
consensus), and monetary theory elements are examined
in the attempt to properly convey the interdisciplinarity of the topic
and appreciate its relevance.

Technical and programming elements about digital signatures,
blockchain, Merkle tree, addresses, transactions, and timestamping
are also provided to assess features and limits of the Bitcoin protocol.

## Prerequisites

There are no strict prerequisites,
even if a computer science mindset
and some familiarity with algebra and finance
might help to appreciate the course.
While a rigorous formal approach is almost impossible
in a course touching on so many and so different knowledge areas,
intellectual curiosity is stimulated about the interplay between
maths, cryptography, economic incentives, technology,
monetary theory, regulatory issues, and politics.

## Exam

Students attending the lessons are asked
to solve the homework assignments for each lesson.
Homeworks have a deadline and are not required/allowed
for students that did not actively partecipate to
the semester activity.

Homework can be tackled cooperatively by team of students,
up to three students. Successfull homeworks will contribute
up to 5 points to the final grade.

Please send the homeworks
to the e-mail that will be indicated with subject
**BBT202010-BICOCCA #1** for the first assignment,
**BBT202010-BICOCCA #2** for the second assignment,
etc.

The final exam will be individual:
a grade of at least 18/30 is required to pass the exam.
