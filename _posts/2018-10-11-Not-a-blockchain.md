Whoever promotes QR encoded URLs as blockchain must be ridiculed.

If 25 years ago somebody would have claimed to deliver pizza as email attachment, the absurdity would have been lost for most people. Similarly, today Carrefour Italia claims to track food using blockchain.

It is true (and powerful) that the (bitcoin) blockchain can guarantee time-stamping, but it cannot guarantee validity, correctness, or accuracy of the content being time-stamped. As such, IBM Food Trust, this Carrefour attempt, and similar initiatives are just dishonest marketing gimmick.
