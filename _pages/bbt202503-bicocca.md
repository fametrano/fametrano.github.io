## Bitcoin, Crypto-Assets, and Blockchain Technology, March-May 2025

University of Milano-Bicocca

e-learning: <https://elearning.unimib.it/course/view.php?id=55237>

If you have an e-mail _@campus.unimib.it_
please join the 202503-bicocca channel in the Slack
[BBT workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/bbt-training/signup)
using your first and last name (no nicknames) and
a profile picture.
Updates and conversations about the course will be posted in the Slack channel.

The course is for the students of University of Milano-Bicocca only;
anyone else, please consider <https://dgi.io/workshop>.

## Learning objectives

The course is an introduction to bitcoin,
crypto-assets,
and the associated blockchain technology.

Game theory, computer science (distributed systems, distributed
consensus), and monetary theory elements are examined
in the attempt to properly convey the interdisciplinarity of the topics
and appreciate their relevance.

## Prerequisites

There are no strict prerequisites,
even if a computer science mindset
and some familiarity with algebra and finance
might help to appreciate the course.
While a rigorous formal approach is almost impossible
in a course touching on so many and so different knowledge areas,
intellectual curiosity is stimulated about the interplay between
maths, cryptography, economic incentives, technology,
monetary theory, regulatory issues, and politics.

## Teaching method

Slide based lessons with associated bibliography.

## Teaching language

English.

## Assessment

To access the _early exam session_,
students must attend the classes
and solve five assignments
that will be assigned during the course.
Please send the assignments via e-mail to the address
ferdinando.ametrano AT unimib DOT it
with subject
**bbt202503-bicocca #1** for the first assignment,
**bbt202503-bicocca #2** for the second assignment,
etc.
E-mail submissions with the wrong address or wrong subject will not be accepted.

The assignments contribute one point each to the final grade (5 assignments, 5 points).
The early exam will be
multiple-choice questions (50 questions, 25 minutes, 25 points, computer based: bring your own laptop),
plus two open questions (10 minutes, 5 points, paper based: bring your own pen).

Later exam sessions will be multiple-choice questions test (62 questions, 30 minutes, 30L points).

The final grade for this half-couse will be averaged with
the grade obtained in the complementary exam by prof. Alessia Pedrazzoli.
