his wife might share the feeling but has never disclosed her opinion officially,
his daughters and son just don't care about his public persona,
his friends consider him bizarre,
his colleagues and students love and hate him depending on their sensitivities and experiences.

Oh... he is an ex-physicist and a huge Springsteen fan.
