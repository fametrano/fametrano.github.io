                  primary questions I'd be writing about for the rest of my work life
                  first took form in the songs on <span class="at">Born to Run</span>

               <blockquote class="talk" id="notbeatenA">I was searching for a tone
                  somewhere between <span class="at">Born to Run</span>'s spiritual
                  hopefulness and '70s cynicism. I wanted my new characters to feel
                  weathered, older, but not beaten. The sense of daily struggle in
                  each song greatly increased. The possibility of trascendence or any
                  sort of personal redemption felt a lot harder to come by. This was
                  the tone I wanted to sustain. I intentionally steered away from any
                  hint of escapism and set my characters down in the middle of a
                  community under siege. [<a href="#notbeatenB">7</a>]</blockquote>

               <blockquote class="talk" id="autobioA">To make <span class="st">"Racing"</span> and those big titles
                  personal, I had to infuse
                  the music with my own hopes and fears. If you don't do that, your
                  characters ring hallow, and you're left with rethoric, words
                  without meaning.<br>
                  Most of my writing is emotionally autobiographical. You've got
                  pull up the things that mean something to you in order for them to
                  mean anything to your audience. That's how they know you're not
                  kidding. [<a href="#autobioB">9</a>]</blockquote>

               <blockquote class="talk" id="autobio2A">You're always writing about
                  yourself: not literally or specifically, but there's got to be some
                  part of you in everything. No matter how you may choose a story or
                  a set of characters that you may have had no experience with, the
                  job is to connect and create understanding, to see yourself in them
                  and have your audience do so too. You try to find that place where
                  there's a fundamental human commonality around very basic issues of
                  work, faith, hope, family, desperation, exuberation, joy. The song
                  always fails unless you can find yourself in those characters in
                  some fashion and so, like I say, I haven't written really literally
                  about myself, maybe on some occasions, but it's a metaphor for your
                  emotional experience. You're trying to capture a piece of the world
                  as you see it - that's what the job is. [<a href="#autobio2B">10</a>]</blockquote>

               <blockquote class="talk" id="politicsA">I think in my own life I
                  had reached where it felt like I was teetering on this void. I felt
                  a deep sense of isolation, and that led me to those characters and
                  to those stories - people I remembered growing up, my father's side
                  of the family, a certain way they spoke, a certain way they
                  approached life, and that resonated through that music. Along with
                  all of a sudden trying to figure out, "Well hey, what if you don't
                  get back in?" I had a lot of sorting out to do around that time.
                  When you get older, the price for not sorting through the issues
                  that that make up your emotional life rises. The same answers and
                  the tricks and the lies that you told yourself at 22 feel a little
                  less comfortable at 26, 28. The older you get the more the price
                  goes up. I was at a place where I could start to really feel that
                  price: I just felt too disconnected, I just wasn't any good, right
                  at the moment that record occurred. So that record had something to
                  do with those things. There are things that make sense of life for
                  people: their friends, the work they do, your community, your
                  relationship with your partner. What if you lose those things, then
                  what are you left with? The political aspect wasn't something that
                  was recily on my mind at the time, it was more just people
                  struggling with those particular kinds of emotional or
                  psychological issues. [<a href="#politicsB">14</a>]</blockquote>

               <blockquote class="talk" id="freedomA">You hear your voice from
                  that particular period of time, and you try to think back to what
                  you were thinking, and who you were, and you probably tell yourself
                  that you're the same. In some essential way you are the same, but
                  of course you're the same person at a very different place in your
                  life. The kid that walked in that particular night hadn't begun to
                  imagine a life with children, a wife, and responsibilities - I was
                  trying to avoid responsibilities, that was why I became a musician.
                  So I find myself coming to terms with those ideas that I ran from
                  for a very long time. That's quite a change. As you get older you
                  realise that where life's satisfactions and new freedoms reside is
                  in making specific choices, choosing the way that your life is
                  going to go. Those choices seem confining when you're young,
                  because you want everything, you live in a fantasy of endless
                  possibility. Then if you have some success there is enormous amount
                  of reel possibility that is handed to you, a dangerous amount, and
                  if you go too far down that particular road, you realise it isn't
                  what it appears to be. You can mistake endless choice for freedom,
                  particularly when everybody wants to say yes to you all the time.
                  There's plenty of fun to be had, but if you don't sort that out
                  it's a recipe for disaster. [<a href="#freedomB">15</a>]</blockquote>

               <blockquote class="talk" id="notaloneA">First of all, everybody has
                  a memory - where do you remember, why do you remember, when you
                  were 11 years old, and you were walking down a particular street on
                  a certain day, there was a certain wind blowing through the trees,
                  and the sound your feet mode on the stones as you came up the
                  drive. Everyone has memories like that, that they carry with them
                  for no explicable reason. And these things live within you. They
                  are an essential part of who you are. It may be that something
                  happened. Maybe nothing happened. But for some reason on that
                  particular day you had some moment of experience that revealed to
                  you what it meant to be alive. How important it is, what you can do
                  with your life. And your life can be brought back to you by the
                  sound of your feet on gravel at a certain moment. That's the
                  writer's job. The writer collects and creates those moments from
                  out of his own experience and the world that he sees around him.
                  Then you use your imagination and put those things together, and
                  you present that experience to your audience, who then experience
                  their own inner vitality, their own centre, their own questions
                  about their own life, and their moral life. Whatever you're writing
                  about, there's a connection made. That's what you're paid for -
                  somebody says, "Hey, I'm not alone. You can do it on stage at night
                  - it can be done just through an explosion of energy at a
                  particular moment in a particular way that makes somebody want to
                  stand up, move themselves, go home and do whatever they feel they
                  need to do. You're just trying to bring forth experience and get
                  people in touch with all of those things in their world. That's the
                  real job, the job that keeps you writing. That's what keeps you
                  wanting to write that next song, because you can do that to people
                  and because if I do it for you, I do it for me. [<a href="#notaloneB">16</a>]</blockquote>
