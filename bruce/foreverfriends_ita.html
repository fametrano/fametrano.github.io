                      - An American Pilgrimage," di Paul Elie. E' la biografia
                      comparata di quattro scrittori cattolici americani:
                      Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Dorothy Day e Thomas
                      Merton. It gets my attention mainly because I love
                      Flannery O'Connor, and I don't know that Walker Percy -

                      and when it comes to delivery options I realize it could
                      be an interesting book for Bruce, so I select 3-5 days
                      delivery and decide that if the book arrives before Milan
                      show I will try to give it to Springsteen.

                      Friday June 27 I have to interview Nils Lofgren. A
                      face-to-face interview has been declined, and it will be a
                      phoner. Nils - I'm told - is at 2-hours drive from Milan.
                      I guess he's in Cernobbio on the Como's Lake, at
                      <a href="https://www.villadeste.it/">Villa d'Este</a>
                      Hotel, where I know Bruce is staying. Nils probably wants
                      to protect Springsteens' privacy. The phone number I
                      receive confirms Villa d'Este hypothesis.

                      In the afternoon a parcel arrives: it's Elie's book. I
                      start reading it immediately: the prologue, the first
                      chapter. It is about the American pilgrimage of those four
                      writers, a pilgrimage being defined as "a journey
                      undertaken in light of a story." How many points of
                      contact with Springsteen's music: his own journey is a
                      pilgrimage, and his art belongs to the root of that big
                      American tradition that includes F. O'Connor and the
                      others. I have to give him this book. I write a dedication
                      letter inside the book, where I thank Bruce and make
                      connections between his music and the book's themes.

                      I know the delivery will be very hard: Villa d'Este is
                      well known for its high security level and privacy
                      respect. It is almost impossible to get in. I take with me
                      wife and kids: at least if my plan fails we will have an
                      ice-cream while walking lake side. We arrive at Villa
                      d'Este: outside a dozen fans are waiting, a security guy
                      watches the entrance.

                      I'm pushing the stroller with my son Simone, 1 year old,
                      while my wife Rosa walks hand in hand with Chiara, 4 years
                      old. We get in as if we were guests, no problem at the
                      first security barrier, but at the second one the security
                      guy approaches us. I explain that I have a book to deliver
                      and in the meantime Simone, usually an unfriendly crying
                      baby, smiles and wave his hand. The security guy smiles
                      too: we're incredibly inside!

                      Villa d'Este is not a traditional hotel: it is a large
                      complex of mansions in a big garden, golf club, a main
                      building near an unique pool floating on the lake, and a
                      private boat park. We walk about half a mile to arrive at
                      the reception.
                      <img

                      />
                      At the reception desk I ask for a post-it that I put on
                      the book's cover, I write "for Bruce Springsteen" and hand
                      the book to the receptionist. He looks at me in suspicion
                      and asks if we are guests. "No, I'm here just for the
                      book" - "Does *he* know about it?" - "Sure, that's why I'm
                      here"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We go out and I'm going toward the exit. I don't consider
                      looking for Springsteen: the complex is large, and I'm
                      already satisfied by the book delivery. Besides I can
                      easily imagine my wife complaining "won't we spend the
                      whole afternoon looking for Springsteen, right?"
                      Unexpectedly Rosa says: "it's such a wonderful place, why
                      don't we take a walk here?"
                    </p>

                      While we wander around we arrive at the lake floating
                      pool. Inside the main large pool there is a built-in
                      Jacuzzi, and Bruce is there, laughing out loud, talking to
                      what looks like a microphone, or probably a mobile phone
                      handed to him by two guys there in the pool. We sit down
                      and look around. On our left there are Nils and Roy with
                      their wives. Patti Scialfa is just a little more distant.
                      Chiara tries hard to recognize Bruce, but the real problem
                      is Simone: after ten minutes he starts crying out loud,
                      everybody looks at us, and I am very embarrassed.

                    <p>
                      I'm even more embarrassed by the idea of being recognized
                      by Nils, since I've met him in London few weeks before. He
                      might think I've used the phone number to get the address.

                    <p>
                      My wife walks Simone around (he's learning to walk) in
                      order to calm him. I wait for the right moment to approach
                      Bruce: it will be hard since it's relax time, family time
                      and I don't want to harass him. At the table near us a
                      boy, probably Bruce's son, sits down with a lady. On the
                      table Harry Potter's books, or maybe a Harry Potter's
                      game.

                    <p>
                      My mobile rings a couple of times: it's friends of mine
                      calling and I tell them where I am and what I'm doing. I
                      switch off the phone to avoid further calls and I suddenly
                      realize that Bruce is gone. My wife reaches me and asks me
                      why I haven't joined her: Patti and a friend of hers were
                      playing with my kids. Rosa doesn't speak English and I
                      could have easily got into a conversation with them. The
                      right moment has been wasted, and Bruce is gone.

                      Things get worse: Simone keeps on crying. In the meantime
                      Patti is eating with friends at a table not far from our
                      place. I ask what time is it: ten to six. I wait a little
                      longer, then I decide to try: since Patti played with my
                      kids I ask Chiara to give her a CD I had with me. The CD
                      is "I'm A Big Girl Now," the bootleg compilation of
                      outtakes, TV appearances, and rare b-sides, produced by
                      Cathy V., an American friend of mine. My daughter doesn't
                      want to go alone, and ask me to join her. We go.
                      <a href="imabiggirlnow.html"
                        ><img
                          align="left"

                          alt=""
                      /></a>
                      We approach Patti and I tell her that my daughter has a
                      gift for her. Patti hugs Chiara, then the usual questions:
                      "what's your name?" "How old are you?" Then she takes the
                      CD. She stares at it, looks at me, then at the back cover
                      for the song list, and a beautiful smile appears on her
                      face. "This is incredible: I've recorded these songs when
                      I was 20." This is not completely true, anyway I avoid to
                      contradict her... "I don't have them anymore, how did you
                      get them?" - "The magic of Internet!" - I reply - "It's a
                      fan-project, a not-for-profit compilation done by a fan of
                      your" - "Wonderful!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It's done! Patti is on cloud nine, and we didn't turn out
                      to be harassers. "I'm going to call my husband!," but the
                      guy that was eating with her replies that Bruce is quite
                      busy right now. "Tell Bruce to come here immediately! It's
                      very important!," and while the guy goes away to call
                      Bruce I think to myself that it's the same story
                      everywhere: wives rule. While waiting for Bruce I ask
                      Patti when her new album will be released. "It's done,
                      it's finished. It will be released next year when Bruce's
                      tour is over." I kindly ask if we can trust Springsteens
                      when it comes to release dates. She laughs and reply that
                      "yes! you can believe me on this! At least this time."

                    <p>
                      Bruce arrives in swimming trunks, with his typical
                      walking, and he appears to me as disappointed. He sits
                      down and Patti starts talking about the CD, commenting
                      songs one by one: "this one is the one that does
                      sha-la-la, this other one is the one that does li-li-li.
                      This one has been written in that session, you remember
                      it? This one has been recorded in that studio, etc." Bruce
                      is not excited, asks for a hamburger that he will eat
                      while he obliges to listen to Patti. I introduce myself in
                      the conversation telling her there is also a second
                      volume, "<a href="somethingsbaby.html">Some Things Baby</a
                      >", and if she is interested I could send her a copy.
                      "Absolutely, please" and talking to a red headed girl she
                      says: "give him the address." I have paper but I haven't a
                      pen, so the girl goes away looking for a pen (that night
                      at home I will realize I had four - F O U R - sharpie pens
                      with me...)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Two kids approach Bruce for autographs, and he takes the
                      pen that just arrived. Bruce has some problem with the
                      spelling of the name Letizia and I help him. The red
                      headed girl turns out to be Kelly K., Patti's assistant,
                      and she writes the address on my notebook. I was expecting
                      a Shore Fire Media address, or maybe a Jon Landau
                      Management address... or even a Sony New York address...
                      this is not the case, the address is that one: Rumson, NJ.
                      Kelly writes down her email address too and says to me:
                      "send the CD to Patti. Anything you need, just ask me."
                      WOW! Then she asks me if I want something signed. "Yes, I
                      would be pleased! Let me get it."

                      I reach into my bag. I have the DVD special edition of The
                      Rising, the limited edition CD single "Live and Rare,"
                      Nils' complete discography, the last album by Soozie
                      Tyrell, the last one by Clarence Clemons, and... my copy
                      of the book SONGS. I pick up SONGS already enjoying what
                      is going to happen. I hand the book to Patti and she hands
                      it to Bruce. I stop her saying that I only want Patti's
                      signature. Bruce is puzzled, looks at me with a priceless
                      face, and hands the book back to Patti. She is also
                      surprised, but the trick is soon revealed: the book
                      already has a wonderful dedication by Bruce on the first
                      page, while on the second there are all E-Street band
                      members' signatures but Patti's. We all laugh, and Patti
                      signs near the other E-Streeters, even if the white space
                      is limited, and doesn't exploit Bruce's page with its
                      large white space available.

                      Time to go. Chiara has been grabbing my leg all along.
                      Rosa has been with Simone, but she was able to set up a
                      kind of gesture conversation with Patti. Patti explained
                      to Rosa she has three kids, and Rosa points to Kelly as if
                      she was one of the kids. Kelly and Patti laugh out loud
                      while Patti in Italian says "no, little, little kids." All
                      in all Bruce up to now hasn't been that much talkative:
                      maybe he's not really disappointed, but surely he is not
                      forthcoming. I try to take time telling them that tomorrow
                      we will be at the show, and Chiara will be with us. I
                      propose to tell a story about Chiara.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Every Thursday night my wife goes out with her friends and
                      I stay home with the kids. When the Live In NYC DVD was
                      released, I experienced its powerful effect on Chiara (at
                      the time 2 and a half years old). One of those Thursday,
                      we had already seen the DVD a couple of times, I was going
                      to put on the latest Neil Young DVD, introducing Neil as
                      Bruce's friend. While I was handling the disc, all of a
                      sudden Chiara asks: "does he play 'hiding on the
                      backstreets'?" As you can imagine Neil Young was
                      immediately archived and the third showing of
                      Springsteen's Live ruled that night. As a father I was
                      very proud of Chiara's musical taste (she doesn't speak
                      English, and - I swore - she's exposed to many different
                      artists, not only Bruce)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      While I'm telling this story, Bruce starts singing without
                      waiting for the end. There he was, in his seat, in
                      swimming trunks, with his hand toward Chiara. Chiara's
                      arms hold tight to my right leg: "Hiding on the
                      Backstreets... Hiding on the Backstreets..." Up to now
                      I've been relatively calm and relaxed. I haven't been
                      overcome by my emotions, as the previous times I've met
                      Bruce. There has been time enough to familiarize with the
                      Springsteens being there at the swimming pool, Patti
                      playing with my kids, talking with Patti, the CD, Bruce's
                      arrival, the autographs. The intensity has been increasing
                      gradually. But Bruce singing Backstreets, here, now, to
                      Chiara... I can't help but thinking "it's a dream... it's
                      so surreal it cannot be true... it's not possible" trying
                      in vain to focus on Bruce's voice. It looked like
                      eternity... finally I get to listen to Bruce, just in time
                      for the final, sweet and intense, "we swore forever
                      friends," sang with an incredible voice, as a whisper,
                      with that hand toward Chiara (yes *that* hand, the one you
                      see in the Live in NYC), with such a tenderness for Chiara
                      that I was speechless, and still I have goose bumps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Once again: time to go. Oh well... it's so many years I
                      long for a photo with Bruce... but in swimming trunks he
                      isn't going to agree.I try with a shy "I guess it's not
                      the right time to have a photo together" Bruce is nodding
                      his head as to confirm it is not the right time, but Patti
                      rules: "you must have a picture with his daughter at
                      least." Bruce calls Chiara: "C'mon baby, c'mon," but
                      Chiara is stone-like grabbing my leg. Patti insists: "you
                      scare her. You should have a picture with her father, and
                      she will relax." Bruce stands up, reaches us, crouches to
                      be as high as Chiara, which sits on my leg, between Bruce
                      and me.

                    <p>
                      I hand the camera to Rosa, and she sits Simone on a chair.
                      With my best smile I tell Rosa: "if you fail this photo
                      I'm going to ask for divorce." I see her scrambling around
                      with the camera. It takes so long I have to say to Bruce
                      something like: "she knows that if she fails this photo I
                      might get upset." First click. "A second one please" I
                      suggest, quite worried about the first one. Patti steps in
                      asking me if I want her to take the picture, so that Rosa
                      could join us. Without thinking about it I reply that I
                      would prefer her to take care of Simone: I'm worried he
                      could fall off the chair. Second click. The pictures will
                      not turn out that good, anyway they are a nice souvenir
                      and at least it is clear it's me, Chiara, and Bruce.

                      My wife will ask me later if I told Patti to take care of
                      Simone. "Yes. Why do you ask this?" - "Just because she
                      has been very kind: she has wrapped him with her arms
                      while he was seated, then since he was still uncomfortable
                      she took him in her arms and played with him." I missed
                      this part completely. I've asked Patti Scialfa to baby-sit
                      Simone: unreal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ok, now is really time to go. We shake hands, hugs and
                      kisses for the kids, promises ("I will send you the CD"),
                      and when it's my turn with Bruce I tell him about the book
                      at the reception for him. He thanks me, but he's clearly
                      not that much interested. I add it's about Flannery
                      O'Connor and Walker Percy, and then he turns to me quite
                      surprised: "Really?" - "Sure! It's in English, it's a new
                      book." This time he really thanks me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      While going out I ask what time is it: 7PM. As strange as
                      it can be, to the first friends asking about this story I
                      reply we've been with Bruce and Patti about 20 minutes: I
                      need my wife to make me realize it's been 40-50 minutes.
                      We swore: forever friends.

                      Friday night I've organized a dinner with friends from all
                      over the world: I'm very late, I know someone will be
                      already at the restaurant waiting. Just to add to my being
                      late Chiara wants to join me and Leo: we're going out
                      without her since she is supposed to go to bed early, in
                      order to stand the show the next day. The reason she wants
                      to join us: she thinks we're going out for dinner with the
                      Springsteens. I smile... as if we were friends with Bruce
                      and Patti... The dinner turned out to be crowded, some
                      people showed up at the last minute. It's very hot, but it
                      seems almost everybody is having a good time. We sing
                      until 1AM, and there is even time for an acoustic
                      Rosalita. Someone comments: "let's hope for a better
                      version tomorrow!"

                      The next day I try to finalize Soozie Tyrell's interview
                      with no luck. It must be written somewhere that I won't do
                      it: I had to ask for rescheduling the interview from
                      Dublin to Milan, this time I don't get a timely
                      confirmation, because PC and mobile phone fail at the
                      wrong moment. Leo and I spend the whole day looking for
                      cables we need to set up our exciting experiment: record
                      the show from the IEM transmissions. It will turn out to
                      be a complete failure: late that night, back from the
                      show, very tired, Leo and I will spend our last energies
                      listening to the tapes looking for something good: it's
                      all crap. The only consolation is to think about a friend
                      I've never met sending me more than $3000 in receivers:
                      "the trust is deep" he wrote. We swore: forever friends.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It's Saturday afternoon: with Rosa, Chiara and a few
                      friends we head down to the show, at the San Siro Stadium.
                      A journalist and a photographer approach us for pictures
                      and a mini-interview. They are from Repubblica, one of the
                      main Italian newspapers. At the end of the interview I
                      add: "we spent one hour yesterday with the Springsteens in
                      a very exclusive swimming pool, but don't write about it
                      since nobody would believe us." The next day
                      <a href="foreverfriends/large/Repubblica20030629.pdf"
                        >our picture</a
                      >
                      is in the newspaper: talk about the chances of meeting the
                      Springsteens and then the next day to have your picture
                      and interview in a newspaper (no mention of the swimming
                      pool)... good karma is flowing around us. And hundreds of
                      phone calls on the arrival for my mobile...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As for the show, it has been the best ever for me (many
                      pictures <a href="Milan2003.html">here</a>). I cannot
                      judge in a objective way, but in a subjective way for me
                      it has been the best ever. It has probably been the show
                      I've watched less, since all my attention was for Chiara:
                      she danced, sang, clapped until the end. We had reserved
                      seats, where it wasn't raining as hard as on the floor.

                        ><img

                          align="right"
                      /></a>
                      Anyway my daughter was always pushing me to the front of
                      the balcony, where it was raining harder, and she wasn't
                      concerned at all about her mother being seated behind (and
                      quite silent). Chiara was asking for our friends: "where
                      is Maria Claudia?" - "She is on the floor, in the front
                      stage" - "Dad, why don't we join her? Why are we so far
                      from the stage?" On Empty Sky Chiara asks me: "why is this
                      song so sad? Why is Bruce so sad?" - "Because it talks
                      about a husband suffering the loss of his wife" - "Oh, I
                      understand. This is why he's sad and wants to sing it with
                      Patti." About Waiting On A Sunny Day: "I think this is my
                      favorite one along with 'hiding on the backstreets'."

                    <p>
                      There are plenty of friends around us: Tiziana, Davide,
                      Walter, Sue, Linda, Leo, Frank, many parents of our
                      friends included. Paolo and his family. I also introduce
                      Chiara to a bald guy, with a Live 75-85 parody t-shirt
                      with Duffy Duck instead of Bruce. He's well known among
                      Italian Springsteen fan and I tell Chiara: "he is a mean
                      guy: every time I invite him for dinner he refuses. He
                      doesn't want to be a friend of ours." Chiara immediately
                      replies: "stop inviting him." Then later she says: "maybe
                      he's just too shy to accept your invitation."
                    </p>

                      During My City Of Ruins for the first time Chiara asks
                      when we'll get back home. Two minutes later Dancing In The
                      Dark sees her dancing very excited. Rosa finally joins us,
                      and we all dance together. It's Rosalita time. All of a
                      sudden Chiara stops and says to me: "I'm going to call Leo
                      to join us dancing." I know the show is going to end, and
                      I watch her naively stepping up. She's going to call her
                      friend Leo. We swore: forever friends.

                    <p>
                      We are going out very slowly. There is time enough to say
                      hi to everybody. Unexpectedly Linda hugs me, as Mary-Ellen
                      the night before: I've exchanged a couple of emails with
                      them before, and I've met them yesterday night for the
                      first time. It is the moment I realize that Springsteen
                      music has really built a community of trust and love.

                      A sandwich on the way out (half for me, half for Chiara)
                      and we walk to our car. My daughter still has questions:
                      "Dad, why didn't Bruce played 'hiding on the
                      backstreets'?" I ponder the answer.... then reply:
                      "Because he already played that one yesterday for you" -
                      "Oh, I got it!" Later on she starts complaining that she's
                      tired, that her shoes are soaked, and she announce she's
                      going to cry. I take her in my arms. She says: "you're a
                      really good dad, I don't want to lose you, for a very long
                      time."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The next day I drive Leo to the airport: he's leaving.
                      That evening we get back to Villa d'Este: Kelly wrote me
                      Bruce hasn't received the book, "could you forward it
                      home, please?" The Springsteens are gone, but this time we
                      cannot get in: Rosa, Simone and two friends of ours have
                      to wait outside. I am the only one to get in, but I take
                      Chiara with me. We arrive at the swimming pool and Chiara
                      asks: "Are Bruce and Patti back home in America?" - "Yes,
                      they are" - "They flew back with Leo, all together,
                      right?" I smile... we swore: forever friends.
