## Bitcoin & Crypto-assets, October-December 2023

with Ferdinando Ametrano (ferdinando DOT ametrano AT essec DOT edu)

Department of Finance, ESSEC Business School  
3 Bernard Hirsch, 95021 Cergy-Pontoise Cedex

## Learning objectives

The course is about bitcoin and crypto-assets,
their economic rationale and potential.

Financial markets, investing, and monetary theory are the focus of the course;
anyway, game theory, computer science (distributed systems,
distributed consensus), and cryptography elements are examined too,
in the attempt to properly convey the interdisciplinarity of the topic and
appreciate its relevance.

Focusing mainly on Bitcoin as reference crypto-asset, the course will also
cover Ethereum, smart assets, ICO, NFT, and the general applicability of
blockchain technology.

The frontier of monetary engineering will be explored.

## Prerequisites

There are no strict prerequisites,
even if a computer science mindset
and some familiarity with algebra and finance
might help to appreciate the course.

While a rigorous formal approach is almost impossible
in a course touching on so many and so different knowledge areas,
intellectual curiosity is stimulated about the interplay between
finance, maths, cryptography, economic incentives, technology,
monetary theory, regulatory issues, and politics.

## Teaching method

* Slide based lessons with associated bibliography
  * Feedback about typos/mistakes to be fixed and clarification to be added is
    very much appreciated
  * Slides are usually revised after each lesson to incorporate the
    class feedback:
    the latest version is always available online and is clearly marked on
    the cover with the revision date
* Python 3 programming assignments and technology assignments
* Possibly, workshops on Bitcoin Core, Electrum, and OpenTimestamps

## Teaching language

English

## Grading

During the course, five assignments will contribute one point each.
Assignments can be tackled by students alone or in group (up to three students).

The final exam will include

* ten multiple choice questions (one point for each right answer);
* two open questions (up to five points for both answers).
