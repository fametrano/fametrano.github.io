## Bitcoin & Crypto-assets, October-December 2022

with Ferdinando Ametrano (B00808399 AT essec DOT edu) and Andrea Roncoroni

Département of Finance, ESSEC Business School  
3 Bernard Hirsch, 95021 Cergy-Pontoise Cedex

## Learning objectives

The course is about bitcoin and cryptoasset, their economic rationale and potential.

Financial markets, investing, and monetary theory are the focus of the course; anyway, game theory, computer science (distributed systems, distributed consensus), and cryptography elements are examined too, in the attempt to properly convey the interdisciplinarity of the topic and appreciate its relevance.

Focusing mainly on Bitcoin as reference cryptoasset, the course will also cover Ethereum, smart assets, ICO, NFT, and the general applicability of blockchain technology.

The frontier of monetary engineering will be explored

## Prerequisites

There are no strict prerequisites,
even if a computer science mindset
and some familiarity with algebra and finance
might help to appreciate the course.

While a rigorous formal approach is almost impossible
in a course touching on so many and so different knowledge areas,
intellectual curiosity is stimulated about the interplay between
finance, maths, cryptography, economic incentives, technology,
monetary theory, regulatory issues, and politics.

## Teaching method

* Slide based lessons with associated bibliography
  - Feedback about typos/mistakes to be fixed and clarification to be added is very much appreciated
  - Slides are usually revised after each lesson to incorporate the feedback: the latest version is always available online and is clearly marked on the cover with the revision date
* Python 3 programming assignments and technology assignments
* Possibly, workshops on Bitcoin Core, Electrum, and OpenTimestamps

## Teaching language

English

## Assessment

There will five homework assignments, each one worth one point.
Assignments can be tackled by group of students, up to three, no more.

The final exam on December 6 will have ten multiple choice questions,
each one worth one point,
and two open questions that will account for the remaining five points.
