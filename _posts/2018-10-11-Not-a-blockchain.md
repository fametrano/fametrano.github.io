If 25 years ago somebody would have claimed to deliver pizza as email attachment, the
implausibility would have probably been lost for most people, as almost nobody was familiar
with email at the time. Similarly, today Carrefour Italia claims to track food using blockchain.

Whoever promotes QR encoded URLs as blockchain must be ridiculed. A legitimate QR code can be simply copied on illegitimate products: as such the landing web page is not reliable.

Moreover, it is true and far-reaching that the (bitcoin) blockchain can guarantee [time-stamping](https://opentimestamps.org/), but it cannot guarantee validity, correctness,or accuracy of the content being time-stamped. So, despite landing on a legitimate web page,
whatever is displayed as being notarized on the blockchain can be false. You can order pizzas via email, but it cannot be delivered by email.

Finally, if https is not used, if the notarizations are not signed, if a non-bitcoin blockchain is used, all these details do compromise the reliability further.

The [IBM Food Trust](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust), 
the [EY Wine Blockchain](https://www.ey.com/it/it/services/advisory/ey-blockchain),
this Carrefour attempt, and similar campaigns are just dishonest marketing gimmick.

What is infuriating about these initiatives is the attempt to promote trust in non-sound technological choices, i.e. misleading advertising.
