After almost 15 years hiatus (why, oh why?) my website is back!

Bear with me while I familiarize with
[GitHub Pages](pages.github.com/),
[Jekyll](jekyllrb.com/),
[MarkDown](markdowntutorial.com/), and [Prose](prose.io)

If you want a similar personal website, start from this quick
[how-to](hackernoon.com/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-a9300366c7b)
or
[here](medium.com/@vovakuzmenkov/get-a-website-with-github-pages-9151ed636446), then also read
[Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
