After 10 years hiatus (why, oh why?) my web site is back!

Bear with me while I familiarize with
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [template](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now),
[MarkDown](https://markdowntutorial.com/), and [Prose](https://prose.io)

If you want a similar personal website, start from this quick
[how-to](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-a9300366c7b)
or
[here](https://medium.com/@vovakuzmenkov/get-a-website-with-github-pages-9151ed636446)
