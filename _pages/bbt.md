## Learning objectives

The course is about bitcoin and the associated blockchain
technology.

Starting from a computationally focused approach to
elliptic curves over finite fields and
presenting the discrete logarithm problem as cornerstone of public-key
cryptography, bitcoin is introduced as ingenious breakthrough innovation.

Its game theory, computer science (distributed systems, distributed
consensus), and monetary theory elements are examined
in the attempt to properly convey the interdisciplinarity of the topic
and appreciate its relevance.

Technical and programming elements about digital signatures,
blockchain, Merkle tree, addresses, transactions, and timestamping
are also provided to assess features and limits of the Bitcoin protocol.

## Prerequisites

There are no strict prerequisites,
even if a computer science mindset
and some familiarity with algebra and finance
might help to appreciate the course.
While a rigorous formal approach is almost impossible
in a course touching on so many and so different knowledge areas,
intellectual curiosity is stimulated about the interplay between
maths, cryptography, economic incentives, technology,
monetary theory, and politics.
