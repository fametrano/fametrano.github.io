[BBT workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/bbt-training/signup)

The course is for the students of University of Milano-Bicocca only;
anyone else, please consider <https://dgi.io/workshop>.

## Learning objectives

The course is an introduction to bitcoin
crypto- assets,
and the associated blockchain technology.

Game theory, computer science (distributed systems, distributed
consensus), and monetary theory elements are examined
in the attempt to properly convey the interdisciplinarity of the topics
and appreciate their relevance.

## Prerequisites

There are no strict prerequisites,
even if a computer science mindset
and some familiarity with algebra and finance
might help to appreciate the course.
While a rigorous formal approach is almost impossible
in a course touching on so many and so different knowledge areas,
intellectual curiosity is stimulated about the interplay between
maths, cryptography, economic incentives, technology,
monetary theory, regulatory issues, and politics.

## Teaching method

Slide based lessons with associated bibliography.

## Teaching language

English.

## Assessment

To access the early exam session,
each student must solve five homeworks
that will be assigned during the course.
Please send the homeworks via e-mail to the address
ferdinando.ametrano AT unimib DOT it
with subject
**bbt202402-bicocca #1** for the first assignment,
**bbt202402-bicocca #2** for the second assignment,
etc.
E-mail submissions with the wrong address or wrong subject will not be accepted.

The homeworks contribute one point each to the final grade (5 homeworks, 5 points).
The early exam will be
multiple-choice questions (40 questions, 20 minutes, 20 points),
plus two open questions (10 minutes, 5 points).

Later exam sessions will be multiple-choice questions test (60 questions, 30 points).

The final grade for this half-couse will be averaged with
the grade obtained in the complementary exam by prof. Alessia Pedrazzoli.
