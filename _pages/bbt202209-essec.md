## Bitcoin & Cryptoassets (FING 31235), September-December 2022

Département of Finance, ESSEC Business School
3 Bernard Hirsch, 95021 Cergy-Pontoise Cedex

The course is for the students of ESSEC Business School only;
anyone else, please consider <https://dgi.io/workshop>.

## Learning objectives

The course is an introduction to bitcoin and cryptoassets.

Financial markets, investing, and monetary theory are the focus of the course;
anyway, game theory, computer science (distributed systems, distributed
consensus), and cryptography elements are examined too,
in the attempt to properly convey the interdisciplinarity of the topic
and appreciate its relevance.

## Prerequisites

There are no strict prerequisites,
even if a computer science mindset
and some familiarity with algebra and finance
might help to appreciate the course.
While a rigorous formal approach is almost impossible
in a course touching on so many and so different knowledge areas,
intellectual curiosity is stimulated about the interplay between
finance, maths, cryptography, economic incentives, technology,
monetary theory, regulatory issues, and politics.

## Teaching method

* Slide based lessons with associated bibliography
* Python 3 programming assignments and technology assignments
* Workshop labs on Bitcoin Core, Electrum, and OpenTimestamps
