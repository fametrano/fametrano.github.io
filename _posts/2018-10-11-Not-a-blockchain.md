If 25 years ago somebody would have claimed to deliver pizza as email attachment, the
implausibility would have probably been lost for most people, as almost nobody was familiar
with email at the time. Similarly, today Carrefour Italia claims to track food using blockchain.

It is true and far-reaching that the (bitcoin) blockchain can guarantee time-stamping, but it cannot guarantee validity, correctness, or accuracy of the content being time-stamped. As such, IBM Food Trust, this Carrefour attempt, and similar initiatives are just dishonest marketing gimmick.

Whoever promotes QR encoded URLs as blockchain must be ridiculed.
