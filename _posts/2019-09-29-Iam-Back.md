title: My site is back!
---

After 10 years hiatus (why, oh why?) my web site is back!

Bear with me while I familiariz myself with
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [template](barryclark/jekyll-now),
and [MarkDown]()

({{ site.baseurl }}/images/201809AmetranoProfileRectangular.jpg)

If you want a similar personal website, start from this
